# Conways-Game-of-life
My first largeish project in C


## What is Conway's game of life
  
  In simple it is a 2d dimensional touring complete set of rules developed by a mathmatician that can also be considered a "0-person game".
  The game is made of a 2D grid where each cell is either "dead" or "alive" and every cycle each cell either lives or dies depending on the amount
  of cells directly around it.
